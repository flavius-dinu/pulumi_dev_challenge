# DevOps Maturity Assessment

Congratulations on completing the **DevOps fundamentals** tutorials! Now it's time to assess your organization's DevOps maturity.

## DevOps Maturity Model

DevOps maturity can be measured across several dimensions:

1. **Culture and Organization**
   - Siloed teams vs. collaborative teams
   - Blame culture vs. learning culture
   - Resistance to change vs. embracing change

2. **Automation**
   - Manual processes vs. automated workflows
   - Script-based automation vs. configuration management
   - Limited CI/CD vs. comprehensive CI/CD pipelines

3. **Measurement and Monitoring**
   - Reactive monitoring vs. proactive monitoring
   - Limited metrics vs. comprehensive metrics
   - Manual reporting vs. automated dashboards

4. **Sharing and Collaboration**
   - Knowledge hoarding vs. knowledge sharing
   - Limited documentation vs. comprehensive documentation
   - Individual work vs. pair programming and code reviews

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Rate your organization on each of these aspects:

- [ ] We have automated our build and test processes
- [ ] We deploy to production at least once per week
- [ ] We use infrastructure as code for all environments
- [ ] We have monitoring and alerting in place
- [ ] We practice blameless postmortems after incidents
- [ ] We have reduced our lead time for changes to less than one day
- [ ] We have a change failure rate below 15%
- [ ] We can recover from failures in less than one hour

## Next Steps for Improvement

Based on your assessment, focus on these areas:

- **Beginning**: Start with version control and basic CI/CD
- **Intermediate**: Implement infrastructure as code and containerization
- **Advanced**: Adopt microservices, advanced monitoring, and chaos engineering
