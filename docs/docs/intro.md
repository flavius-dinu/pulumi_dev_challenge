# DevOps Fundamentals

Let's explore the **core principles of DevOps** and how they can transform your software delivery process.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably.

## Key DevOps Principles

1. **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams
2. **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery**: Regularly integrating code changes and delivering to production
4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Collecting and analyzing data to improve processes
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes

## Getting Started

To begin your DevOps journey, you'll need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for containerization
- A CI/CD tool like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/download/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Infrastructure as Code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

## Create Your First DevOps Pipeline

Let's set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Basic CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up environment
      run: echo "Setting up environment"
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: echo "Running tests"
      
    - name: Build application
      run: echo "Building application"
```

This simple pipeline will run whenever code is pushed to the main branch or when a pull request is created.
